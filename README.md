comp20-mtung

Repository containing course files, homeworks and labs written as part of my 
Web Programming course taken over the Summer of 2016 at Tufts University.

As can be seen by the progression of the projects, the files written build up 
from the basics of front-end web fundamentals (like my_old_kentucky_home) to
more in-depth web apps like the mbta project, whose backend code was also
written as part of the project.
